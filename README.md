In this workshop, I’ll show you the real power of Flutter and how easily you, as a beginner, can create apps for both Android and iOS.  

We’ll build an e-commerce app from scratch and also cover how designers share UI designs using tools like Figma. You’ll learn how to understand those designs and turn them into a perfect Flutter UI.  

There are three branches for the project:  
- **Starting** – for the basic project setup.  
- **Onboard** – which has the code for the onboarding screen.  
- **Sign In** – which has the code for the sign-in screen.  

Thanks for checking it out, and happy coding!
